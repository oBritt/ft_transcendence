üöÄ Installation
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/TomTris/42-Ft_transcendence
cd ft_transcendence
fill out .env file.

Please change some character is Secret key, this is your django secret key.
Privatekey and deployer account is your metamask wallet and it needs to have holesky ETH in there.
You can collect it here: https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky

Additional for 2FA.
EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
will be your own email. You need to enable SMTP for that.
I know it' complicate to enable it, so i commented out send_email() function  in ft_transcendence/users/utils and ft_transcendence/users/management/commands/send_email.py.
And for the code for 2FA, you can type docker logs my_django -f after you type make, i will print out the code when you register, login bla bla, so that you can ignore this step.

then, make
afterwards
https://localhost:443
If you are in 42 cluster, you can use your local IP address to connect remotely.
or, if you are the unique person, who at the moment run my project, you also can access it through: https://deciding-delicate-raptor.ngrok-free.app. It creates a tunnel linked to our server.
Then, Enjoy
